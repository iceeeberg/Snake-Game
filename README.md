## Summary

This application introduced me to the concepts on how to use HTML 5 canvas and how JavaScript interacts with it. It helped me better understand arrays and for loops and how to use them with programming. Prior to building this app I would have to say learning arrays and for loops was one of my weaknesses whenever I first started learning to program.  Overall, I had fun building this application as it was exciting getting to build a game while also getting to push myself to overcome one of my weaknesses.
